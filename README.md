# DP-Morph

This repository contains the implementation of the code for the paper "**DP-Morph: Improving the Privacy-Utility-Performance Trade-off for Differentially Private OCT Segmentation**".
Our paper has been accepted at **ACM CCS 2025**, presented in the **18th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec)**.


# About

Medical imaging models, particularly for **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**, play a crucial role in diagnosing retinal diseases. However, using sensitive medical data for training introduces **privacy concerns**, as attackers can infer whether a specific patientâ€™s data was used.

This project explores the trade-offs between **privacy**, **segmentation accuracy**, and **computational efficiency** when applying **Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD)** to OCT segmentation models. We benchmark five state-of-the-art segmentation models:

- **U-Net**
- **LFUNet**
- **Y-Net-Gen**
- **FCN8s**
- **NestedUNet**

Here you can see the Performance of different models on Duke (top) and UMN (bottom) datasets. The top row shows non-private perfor-
mance, the two bottom rows show results with DPSGD training for Îµ = 8 and Îµ = 200. Comparison with the true mask (lower
left) shows that most models provide unsatisfactory segmentation performance with high privacy protection (Îµ = 8)

under different privacy budgets (Îµ) and measure:

- **Utility** â€“ Segmentation accuracy (*Dice coefficient*, *MAE*, *Loss*)
- **Privacy** â€“ Theoretical (Îµ, Î´) guarantees & empirical *Membership Inference Attacks*
- **Performance** â€“ *GPU memory*, *runtime*, *energy consumption*

To mitigate the accuracy loss caused by DPSGD, we propose **DP-Morph**â€”a novel method that integrates **differentiable morphological operations** (like *dilation* and *erosion*) into the training pipeline, improving segmentation quality without weakening privacy guarantees.
The following image shows the Segmentation performance of DP-Morph with NestedUNet for different morphological operators:

# Datasets

We use the Duke and UMN datasets, which are also included in this repository.

# OCT_Segmentation

This directory includes all codes that are necessary for generating morph and non-morph results for both DPSGD and non-DPSGD cases.
## Requirements
First, the following packages should be installed:

```bash
pip install torch tqdm numpy matplotlib opacus kornia torchinfo

``` 
If you plan to use fastDP library, install:

```bash
pip install fast-dp

```
## Training
For running the code, you can:

```bash
python train-one-gpu.py --dataset UMN --n_classes 2 --batch_size 16 --num_iterations 200 --learning_rate 0.0005 --model_name NestedUNet --morphology True --operation "close" 

```
For non-morph cases, set morphology to False and there is no need to define the operation.
To run the code in a privacy-preserving manner (using DPSGD), you should:

```bash
python train-one-gpu.py --dataset UMN --n_classes 2 --batch_size 16 --num_iterations 200 --learning_rate 0.0005 --model_name NestedUNet --morphology True --operation "close" --DPSGD True cuda 

```

For running the fastDP mode ,just replace train_one_gpu.py with train-one-gpu_fast.py.

# Computational Plots

You can use plot_non_morph_computational.py to generate the computational plots reported in the paper.
